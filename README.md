# Azure Object Detection Accelerator

This repository serves as a starting point and accelerator for object detection projects on Azure. The walkthrough will help you to quickly setup training, labelling, inference, testing and deployment pipelines. A starter dataset is generated for demonstration purposes to show you where to place your data. The pipelines clearly show the steps required so that changes can be easily made as required.

## Prerequisites

In order to setup your solution you will need the following:

- Access to an Azure subscription
- Access to an Azure DevOps subscription

## Getting Started

Follow the walkthrough in docs/setup_walkthrough.md for a full detailed walkthrough. The walkthrough can be finished in under an hour and requires no coding.
