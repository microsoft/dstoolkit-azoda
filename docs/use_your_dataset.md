### Use your own dataset

To use your own dataset add another folder with the same structure as **synthetic_dataset** in the datastore. If you don't have annotations, you can just put in the images folder and use the Custom Vision pipelines to get annotations. Then change the dataset variable in the variable group to the new folder name.
