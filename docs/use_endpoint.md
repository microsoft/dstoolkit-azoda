### Test your endpoint

To test the demo endpoint, you will need to fetch the endpoint address and key, then run the example script. To fetch the endpoint information, first go to your [Azure Portal](http://portal.azure.com/) and search for your Azure Machine Learning workspace, by default **azoda-amlw**, then **Launch studio**, then **Endpoints** on the left, select the latest one, then **Consume**, then copy the **REST endpoint** and **Primary key**. Enter these into the script found in src/auto_setup/consume_endpoint.py and the path to an example image. To install the required libraries for the script run `pip install -r src/auto_setup/consume_requirements.txt`. To quickly see the results, it is recommended to run the script interactively, otherwise the output image with bounding boxes will be stored in the current directory.
